/**
* \brief Determine the set of methods that are overridden by the given

*
* In both Objective-C and C++, a method (aka virtual member function,

* Objective-C, a method is said to override any method in the class's
* base class, its protocols, or its categories' protocols, that has the same
* selector and is of the same kind (class or instance).
* If no such method exists, the search continues to the class's superclass,
* its protocols, and its categories, and so on. A method from an Objective-C
* implementation is considered to override the same methods as its
* corresponding method in the interface.
*
* For C++, a virtual member function overrides any virtual member
* function with the same signature that occurs in its base
* classes. With multiple inheritance, a virtual member function can
* override several virtual member functions coming from different
* base classes.
*
* In all cases, this function determines the immediate overridden
* method, rather than all of the overridden methods. For example, if
* a method is originally declared in a class A, then overridden in B
* (which in inherits from A) and also in C (which inherited from B),
* then the only overridden method returned from this function when
* invoked on C's method will be B's method. The client may then
* invoke this function again, given the previously-found overridden
* methods, to map out the complete method-override set.
*
* \param cursor A cursor representing an Objective-C or C++
* method. This routine will compute the set of methods that this
* method overrides.
*
* \param overridden A pointer whose pointee will be replaced with a

* methods. If there are no overridden methods, the pointee will be
* set to NULL. The pointee must be freed via a call to

/**
* \brief Perform code completion at a given location in a translation unit.
*
* This function performs code completion at a particular file, line, and
* column within source code, providing results that suggest potential
* code snippets based on the context of the completion. The basic model
* for code completion is that Clang will parse a complete source file,
* performing syntax checking up to the location where code-completion has
* been requested. At that point, a special code-completion token is passed
* to the parser, which recognizes this token and determines, based on the
* current location in the C/Objective-C/C++ grammar and the state of
* semantic analysis, what completions to provide. These completions are
* returned via a new \c CXCodeCompleteResults structure.
*
* Code completion itself is meant to be triggered by the client when the
* user types punctuation characters or whitespace, at which point the
* code-completion location will coincide with the cursor. For example, if \c p
* is a pointer, code-completion might be triggered after the "-" and then
* after the ">" in \c p->. When the code-completion location is afer the ">",
* the completion results will provide, e.g., the members of the struct that
* "p" points to. The client is responsible for placing the cursor at the
* beginning of the token currently being typed, then filtering the results
* based on the contents of the token. For example, when code-completing for
* the expression \c p->get, the client should provide the location just after
* the ">" (e.g., pointing at the "g") to this code-completion hook. Then, the
* client can filter the results based on the current token text ("get"), only
* showing those results that start with "get". The intent of this interface
* is to separate the relatively high-latency acquisition of code-completion
* results from the filtering of results on a per-character basis, which must
* have a lower latency.
*
* \param TU The translation unit in which code-completion should
* occur. The source files for this translation unit need not be
* completely up-to-date (and the contents of those source files may
* be overridden via \p unsaved_files). Cursors referring into the
* translation unit may be invalidated by this invocation.
*
* \param complete_filename The name of the source file where code
* completion should be performed. This filename may be any file
* included in the translation unit.
*
* \param complete_line The line at which code-completion should occur.
*
* \param complete_column The column at which code-completion should occur.
* Note that the column should point just after the syntactic construct that
* initiated code completion, and not in the middle of a lexical token.
*
* \param unsaved_files the Tiles that have not yet been saved to disk
* but may be required for parsing or code completion, including the
* contents of those files.  The contents and name of these files (as
* specified by CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the
* client only needs to guarantee their validity until the call to
* this function returns.
*
* \param num_unsaved_files The number of unsaved file entries in \p
* unsaved_files.
*
* \param options Extra options that control the behavior of code
* completion, expressed as a bitwise OR of the enumerators of the
* CXCodeComplete_Flags enumeration. The
* \c clang_defaultCodeCompleteOptions() function returns a default set
* of code-completion options.
