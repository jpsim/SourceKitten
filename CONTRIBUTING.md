## Tracking Changes

All changes should be made via pull requests on GitHub.

When issuing a pull request, please add a summary of your changes to
the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

We follow the same syntax as [CocoaPods' `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md):

1. One Markdown unnumbered list item describing the change.
2. 2 trailing spaces on the last line describing the change.
3. A list of Markdown hyperlinks to the change's contributors. One entry
   per line. Usually just one.
4. A list of Markdown hyperlinks to the issues the change addresses. One entry
   per line. Usually just one.
5. All `CHANGELOG.md` content is hard-wrapped at 80 characters.
